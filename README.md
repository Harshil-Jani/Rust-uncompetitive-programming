# Rustic Programming (Uncompetitive)

This repository is my solutions in rust to the problems in some programming platforms. I am already attaching the apology letter to god for doing this thing.

But frankly speaking this has to be unique. Give me a month and I will promise uniqueness.

### To-Do

- [ ] Setup CI/Github Bot to judge if the solution contains Problem Link.
- [ ] Setup CI/Github Bot to judge if the solution contains an apology letter to almigty god.
- [ ] Write contributions guidelines and brainstrom who to get folks comfortable with rust ensuring their smooth learning curve.
- [ ] Develope a CLI command or binary to extract the `NOTE` and `DOUBT` from each file if any.
- [ ] Check against sample test cases in the CI.
